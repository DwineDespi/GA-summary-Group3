Lastly, for the closing remarks 4 main things had happened

1. Open Forum
2. Food Distribution
3. Picture Taking
4. Evaluation of General Assembly

Overall, we believe that the General Assembly was successful in providing information to the student both the upperclassmen and
for the freshman. It had successfully disseminated information which would be beneficial to the participants especially the freshmen.
