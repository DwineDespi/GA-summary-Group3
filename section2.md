# TACTICS 1st General Assembly
## Student Concerns and Feedback
<br>

### SRA Retention 
It was discussed that most students tried to appeal for their SRA subject. Since most of them are having a hard time on finishing it before their 3rd year starts. The only way that TACTICS could help out on this matter is opeing the subject during intersession. It also stated that most of the students who failed has a direct link to their attendance> Most of those who are complaining are those who dont attend fully the subject when they have the time. So its really a problem that only student themselves can solve not the organization.
