# Student Concerns and Feedbacks
## SRA Retention
<br>

It was discussed that most students tried to appeal for their SRA subject, since many of them are having a hard time finishing it before their 3rd year starts. The only way that TACTICS could help with this matter is by opening the subject during intersession. It was also stated that most of the students who failed had issues directly related to their attendance. Most of those who are complaining are the ones who did not fully attend the subject when they had the time. So, it is really a problem that only the students themselves can solve, not the organization.
